This is a project for NLP course in University of Helsinki.

The goal was to implement Yarowsky’s bootstrapping word-sense disambiguation algorithm with automatic evaluation. Note that in order to use the code you need to have your data in the same folder with this folder. In case you use your own dataset, you need to change the path in the code.
